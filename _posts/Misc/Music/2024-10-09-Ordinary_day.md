> This is just an ordinary day  
Wipe the insecurities away  
I can see that the darkness will erode  
Looking out the corner of my eye  
I can see that the sunshine will explode  
Far across the desert in the sky
>
> Beautiful girl  
Won't you be my inspiration?
Beautiful girl  
Don't you throw your love around  
What in the world, what in the world  
Could ever come between us?  
Beautiful girl, beautiful girl  
I'll never let you down  
Won't let you down
> 
> This is the beginning of your day  
Life is more intricate than it seems  
Always be yourself along the way  
Living through the spirit of your dreams
> 
> Beautiful girl  
Won't you be my inspiration?  
Beautiful girl  
Don't you throw your love around  
What in the world, what in the world  
Could ever come between us?  
Beautiful girl, beautiful girl  
I'll never let you down  
Won't let you down  
Down, down
